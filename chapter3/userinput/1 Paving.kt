/*
* The program prompts the user to enter the length and width of the driveway using println().
* The readln() function is used to read user input from the console, which returns a String.
* The toDouble() method is called on the input String to convert it to a Double data type,
* and assign the values to length and width.

* The area and perimeter are calculated using the formulas: area = length * width,
* and perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

* Finally, the results are displayed to the user using println().
